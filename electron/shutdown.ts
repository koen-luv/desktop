// Quitting used to depend on a chain of events (main window closed -> overlay
// destroyed -> app.quit() -> window-all-closed). If any link threw or stalled,
// the hidden overlay window or a child process kept the process alive with the
// single-instance lock still held, so the next launch exited silently and no
// window ever appeared. This helper makes the sequence idempotent, isolates
// failures between cleanup steps and force-exits if a graceful quit hangs.
